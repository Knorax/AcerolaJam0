# Game Info 
## Game Type
This game is a simple autoscroller game. The objective is to complete the level without losing all your health, and defeat enemies along the way (a bit like the autoscroller level in cuphead, but you're falling instead like in Downwell).

## Engine
This game is made in Godot 4, using mostly C# scripts.
